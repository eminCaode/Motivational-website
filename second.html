            <h1>War for your mind</h1>
            <p>When they knocked you down, when they try shit on you,When they talked shit about you, and then they tramp with their foot on your neck. If you stay at down ,you can't get that resolve. War for your mind and you feels this level of the happiness that will evelate you. Even one time your life you feel this happiness.</p>
